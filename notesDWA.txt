Removed GUI entirely - Caused too many issues. Can revisit when core code is good. 
Removed JIT implementation in algos - changed to scipy library
next - change fwhm fitting from leastsqs to curve_fit DONE
Spots.py
    find_in_frame - made more readable and modular
    merge_conincident_candidates - removed nested loop apprach and uses scipy.KDtree 
    filter_candidates - removed all the loops. now uses a boolean mask of all filters on each spot and then applies all at once
    refine_centres - Multiprocessor now
    get_spot_widths - parallelised
    get_spot_intensities - parallelised
Trajectories.py
    compare_trajectories - added graph of metric
tracking.py
    track_frame - returns success rate of fitting
    track - facilities fitting succes rate

make docstrings where needed
